**#ABSTRACT**

The casino game is for entertainment purposes especially during this covid situation.
The project is in C++ language of the fact that it is one of the fastest programming of game development engines.
This application will teach basics for game creation and storage handling by management of bets.
It will also teach us more about functions, classes & objects and their implementation.
To make this whole project I have mainly used concepts like switch statements, while loop, sleep function, random function(rand).
Also user defined functions have been created for printing rules , placing bet through betting function , play again, making games , game menu , main menu operations
and for exiting the game.

**#WORKING**

Menus have been created for selecting the game that user wants to play and the amount of bet he wants to put.
From the main menu the user can place his bets if he wishes to and then can either go to the game menu or exit the game.

In Game Menu 3 games have been created for the user to enjoy namely:

**Card Guesser :**
The user has to select a random card that is present in a deck of cards
(52 cards numerically ranging from 1 to 10,J,Q,K as 11,12,13 respectively and four suits Heart ,Diamond, Spade and Clubs).
The program will too generate a random card. 
The user wins twice his bet if placed if either his suit/number matches 
and thrice the bet if both suit and number matches the card generated by program. In case he loses his bet will be halved.

**7Streak :**
A random number will be generated by the program ranging from 10 to 999.
If the number is 70-79 or 770-779 then the user wins depending whether random generated number is 77,777 or other number.
For number 777 user gets 10 times his bet. 
For number 770-779 except 777 user gets 5 times his bet. 
For number 77 user gets 3 times his bet. 
For number 70-79 except 77 user gets 2 times his bet.

**Blackjack :**
It is also known as twenty-one and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.
Blackjack is a comparing cardgame between a player and dealer, meaning players compete against the dealer but not against other players. 
It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways: 
• Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack. 
• Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21. 
• Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21

The player or players are dealt a two-card hand and add together the value of their cards.
Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted as ten points.
A player and the dealer will count an ace as 1 point. 
All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card.
After receiving their first two cards, players have the option of getting a "hit", or taking an additional card.
In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the higher score that is less than 21.
Scoring higher than 21 (called "busting" or "going bust") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts.
No bets are placed in this game.


After the game ends the user can choose to either play again and will be redirected to main menu or choose to exit.
